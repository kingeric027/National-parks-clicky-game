This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## National Parks Clicky-Game

### Description: This game requires users to attempt to click on the images displayed withoug clicking on the same image twice. After every click event the images reshuffle to a different location on the grid. The game keeps track of the user's score as well as the current high score. 

### Technologies used: This app uses the React.js library to dynamically render the different components. When the user clicks an image the states are updated and the images are shuffled with a built in function.
